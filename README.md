Hello everyone, welcome to my first coding app!
A simple Python application that scans your Steam library, identifies installed games, and displays custom quotes for each game.
If you wanted to, you can edit the PY file to make more quotes for more games!

Unfortunately, this app is for Windows so you can't use it for Mac or Lunix. 
I'll try to figure it out soon but for now... Windows Only!!!
